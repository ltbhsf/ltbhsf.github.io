      <p>When I first visited the NGV website, what caught my attention was the section introducing the <b>featured exhibitions at the bottom of the main page.</b> 
        I have a habit of <em>scrolling down immediately</em> upon visiting a specific site to grasp the overall structure of the webpage. 
        Due to this, information about NGV's location, operating hours, and such at the top of the page didn't take priority in capturing the user's attention.</p>

      <p>NGV generates value through artworks that provide visual impact. This essence of the organization is ingrained in constructing the NGV's website, seeking structural consistency while strategically placing a variety of products for visual appeal. Consequently, <b>I believe that NGV has almost succeeded in creating a website experience that aligns with its primary goal of arousing user interest in NGV's products, and enticing offline visit experiences.</b></p>

      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      
      <p>This website strives to <b>enhance accessibility to information</b> about the diverse products the organization offers. More specifically, information regarding the curated exhibition programs can be accessed from various locations such as the "What's On" page, the main page, and the "What's On - Exhibition" page. Furthermore, it suggests straightforward navigation paths for obtaining information even from pages unrelated to the respective programs.</p>

      <p>
        In my personal impression, I will likely revisit this website <b>at least 1 or 2 times a week</b> during my stay in Melbourne. Through my initial website experience, I realized that NGV offers a variety of exhibitions that are available only for certain periods. Thus, I will engage in periodic interactions to discover new programs. I believe NGV will find ways to encourage customers like me, who consistently engage with their offerings, to visit regularly, <b>possibly aligning with the opening of new curated exhibitions.</b>

      <p>This website adopts the format of blogging platforms such as Squarespace, Tistory, and Wix.

      <p>
        <b>Click Our posts and read them!"</b> This is what I believe this reference communicates to me. Specifically, when interpreted, this reference designs an interactive approach that prompts users to 1) select relevant information on the topic and 2) interpret and utilize the information. NGV seems to create a structure where each exhibition program functions like an individual block, much like a honeycomb, and users are expected to click on them to read the information and subsequently engage in a chain of actions such as purchasing online tickets and visiting the exhibitions.

      <p>They are designed to make users feel that the descriptions of the selected exhibition programs contain <b>"sufficiently appealing and comprehensive information."</b> If there is insufficiently captivating visual material and introductions to the artists to indirectly convey the offline viewing experience at NGV, or if essential information such as exhibition duration, artists, admission costs, etc., is missing, users could accumulate negative experiences with the NGV website.</p>

      <p>
        I often visit websites related to museums or exhibitions, and I felt that NGV provides an above-average user experience. However, one disappointing aspect is its lack of sufficient <b>compatibility with various physical devices.</b> For instance, while accessing the site with a laptop allows full use of all functions, using a mobile phone to read information or navigate between pages leads to various errors. Moreover, image animations and motions that are not essential to the service cause slowdowns in the mobile environment.

      <br>
      
      <p>I believe that modern internet users tend to prefer visual elements such as images and videos over long texts. What surprised me while using this site is that despite using a considerable amount of <b>text</b>, they employed various effects to make it engaging and appealing. They actively utilize techniques like proper spacing and paragraph separation for readability, along with bolding important content, which align with their purpose. Due to this, I was able to read text easily and choose the desired exhibition programs</p>
